About
==

The purpose of this fork is primarily to allow University of Surrey's CCSR to download source code for the OpenBeacon project, and compile it on the latest version of Ubuntu with minimal hassles. My aim is to keep code as close as possible to the upstream version, whilst maintaining ease of use for people who may have never used Linux before.

For more information on what the CCSR are doing with OpenBeacon, please read http://www.privmsg.me.uk/2012/08/playing-with-openbeacon/114/
